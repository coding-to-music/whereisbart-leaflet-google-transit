# WhereisBART.com

Whereisbart.com is a live visualization of the estimated positions of all BART ([Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://bart.gov)) trains.
The positions are estimated using realtime arrival predictions from the [BART API](https://www.bart.gov/schedules/developers/api.aspx).
The estimated travel time between all stations was determined and trains are plotted on a map.
The map assumes normal operating conditions - any delays in the BART system will cause the estimated positions on the map to be inaccurate.

The map layer is the [Google Transit layer](https://blinktag.com/google-transit-layer-through-google-maps-api/).

The data is queried every 5 seconds and refreshed as needed.

## Updates

- Oct-2018
improve active train location
move trains smoothly to the new position
station info when selected
more space for the map
change train icons
debug mode when clicking the legend station icon

# Known limitations
last leg is always missing (bart does not provide this info)
the Antioch / SFO-Milbrae line is messy, since trains go/return to/from SFIA and BLBR
in Antioch trains always leave with destination MLBR, and then it changes when they reach PITT
